850,The ambiance of the place is nice but the food is not tasty. I don't think I will come again.,
716,Meals were prepared neatly and cleanly. It was a pleasant dining experience in a decent place. Thank you very much.,
429,It gets very crowded because it's the weekend; we have to go a little early; you may not find a place to eat something,
185,Waiters were better than Meram branch. Although the taste of Etliekmek is not very good; you can easily bring your guests from outside the city.,
599,I love fried chicken; I love KFC.,
310,First of all; our orders came very quickly. Edamame came without salt; which we liked a lot. You can add your own. We ordered tuna and salmon as sashimi. I couldn't eat good sashimi in Istanbul for a long time; unfortunately this place did not pass the exam.,
1066,A cafe where books and coffee are combined very well.,
406,The food is delicious; the view is beautiful.,
835,Thanks for the nice service.,
360,I tried Antep taco; I liked.,
102,The menu is incomplete; not much; usually a disaster with happy sweet toys; felt-tip pens and a few cardboard coloring pages.,
351,Kofteci Yusuf tastes the same everywhere. employees are constantly running towards somewhere; it is very difficult to catch and order.,
505,We ate küşleme; it was amazing. But as you can see; really really expensive.,
405,Due to the crowd; my order came late; there is no problem other than that.,
812,Generally good service thank you!,
352,We told the staff a very modest breakfast plate; there is unlimited tea; and the breakfast was really good. There was everything up to 4 kinds of cheese and it only cost 54 liras.,
459,Despite the current times; it was a very pleasant visit. They currently don’t take booking; they have a walk-in system where you put your name down and after a short wait they seat you inside. Once inside you can opt to be put on a waitlist to sit outside. The setting is really nice and rustic and the tables are well distanced. There was a nice evening crowd and a good energy in the ambience.,
267,Overall it wasn't bad. It was delicious and ice cold. Mohair meat was delicious. The fries were nice. However; the bread that gives the place its name is a disappointment.,
880,Egg dish was super salty. Beef with veggies was really good. A bit on the pricier side compared with local Turkish food; but when your Thai GF wants a taste of home; hard to argue over price.,
674,Every meal is a source of happiness at Magro. This time we tried chicken with almond sauce and Mac and cheese bolognese; it was delicious. Portions are very filling and very reasonable for the price.,
157,A delicious doner.,
544,Bread; cheese; sausage all left incredible flavors on our palate. We recommend it to everyone who will go to Ayvalık.,
10,The most f/p of all businesses I've seen.,
772,Bazlama and menemen were delicious. The place was not clean so I did not have a pleasant dining experience.,
329,I went to there with my girl friend; I liked fishes but she did not like because fishes are a little bit oily.,
82,As I was crossing the road; I noticed that we stopped. The light ad is very good because everything has ice cream icons. The only normal price I've seen in Fethiye is 6 TL.,
210,160-year-old Vefa Bozacisi has not lost its flavor. We can find filled bottles in many places; but it's different to come here and drink. It's definitely fresher to drink on the spot.Vefa Bozacısı,
585,A delicious udon that you can enjoy even in the middle of summer! It was very hot; cramped and crowded with people and I had two bowls of udon and a side dish with two bottles of booze.,
73,Great.,
300,Prices are very affordable; boyoz is fresh and nice. Finding breakfast items such as olives; cheese and honey in addition to Boyoz also adds to the beauty.,
371,It's a great place with everything; it's a very good place whether it's about food or interest; it's a very nice place for waffles.,
584,Prices were cheap. But the queue was too long. I liked the flavors as a korean.,
290,The cheddar pastry was very bad compared to the past. It has reached the level of a normal patisserie; it used to be better.,
297,Recommend.,
216,The number of tables is very small; but no problem; the taste was very good.,
468,classic alavara pasta; if you don't have a tiny little stomach; say it right. Pasta 42 TL price performance product...,
530,We ate oil ravioli and special ravioli. The ravioli was weak compared to the price. Employees are smiling.,
95,I never liked the service very bad; when we brought the wrong burger and returned it; we had to wait that much longer. The potatoes were terrible; the only onion rings and mushrooms were beautiful. I will never go to this place again.,
722,Nice atmosphere!,
528,Expensive; poor presentation; taste was not good enough to come from out of town and try. There are no treats.,
1028,There are many queues. There is a lack of coordination in the place. Even though you ask for service; they take the bill as soon as the food arrives. Not everyone can eat sitting down; We ate standing.,
57,We ordered Etli Ali Nazik Kebab. They said he was the most famous. We ate meat with yogurt. The food was cold.,
889,Delicious food; but their toilets are filthy. That's why I'm deducting points.,
662,It is a place that can be preferred for taste; but the appetizer variety is very weak. The toilets smelled.,
759,Menu was like that; Recommend.,
433,The place is beautiful and clean. The employees were very kind and concerned. I ate rice and also had sautéed chicken. The flavor was good except the chicken sauté was greasy.,
466,They serve an uncooked pasta with a tasteless sauce and cheese and some corn. Half portion is 20 TL. It didn't suit my taste.,
59,Ali nazik was 240 tl lahmacun 50 tl even tea with a fee of 5 tl. We visited so many places; this was the most expensive.,
931,The waiters are scruffy so we didn't feel comfortable eating. The hygiene of the place was also bad.,
4,Turkey's cheapest artisan restaurant and its food is delicious!,
356,Asian salmon pastas and salad varieties are very successful. They have not neglected to share the secret of their taste.,
778,Home cooking is not bad in terms of taste. We waited about an hour for the manti to eat. Also; the place is a little small.,

32,It's a very delicious; beautiful small business; but the appointment is a bit difficult to find; the pizzas are great Cafe Inn pizza and a wonderful 4 cheese and brownie as dessert. Thank you for your good wishes.,
282,There was no delay in meals. As soon as the soup was finished; the meal arrived. The meals are quite delicious.,
1035,We went for dessert; but there are also food and breakfast options. It's not a huge venue and it gets pretty busy. We ate moblan; ibiza; strawberry puff pastry desserts. Moblan comes in huge portions. Desserts are very tasty and fresh.,
3,Prices are very affordable. The menu in the photo cost 108 liras. You have to wait 10-15 minutes for food. Staff is annoying. Well it tastes good. Boiled meat was delicious.,

1100,Excellent pizza and fine wine. Both food and beverage portions are large. I recommend.,
774,Delicious foods. I think place has to more cleaner.,
446,We came with a guest from abroad; everything was perfect. Taste; cleanliness; service..,

630,The rice was very oily but the roast was delicious. We paid 450₺ for 3 people. Prices are a little high.,

50,When I ate it in the past; it tasted very good; I think the chef has changed. The atmosphere was average.,

680,Great service; great food; everything is great!,
1004,The hamburger patty is very small; but it is very tasty and different with its unique sauce and bread. It was not pleasant that there were no potatoes in the menu.,

1089,The meat is DELICIOUS; the price is reasonable; but the service is poor.,
589,The best udon restaurant in the capital! Few tables however; making a lot of waiting at peak times.,
760,The attitude of the waiters towards the customer was cold.,
159,Interest was good; but doner was a complete disaster. First of all; it came cold; there was no proper sauce in it; there was so much onion that I could not taste the meat at all.,
486,I definitely recommend the seasonal kenger pizza. We also loved the sauce in three different olive oils; one with garlic; thyme and hot pepper.,
701,Amazing!,
854,The plate in the photo was around 340 TL. Flavors may be a bit difficult for those who will try for the first time.,
828,We went on a Friday and all the tables were full at first. Service; waiters; the ambiance is very nice. The menu was a little expensive.,
1069,This café was highly recommended by an Istanbul-based blogger for its soufflés. The unique 2D interiors and decorations caught my eye as soon as I entered.

257,Tantuni was amazing. Thank you Cici Tantuni!,

487,You can't get enough of the thin pizza dough. Overcrowded employees are very concerned. We ate pizza at Mia highly recommend.,

886,I did not recommend. Bad service.,
618,The kokorec and sauced mussels of this branch next to the sea are quite good.,
7,What you see is 125 TL in total. It's a pretty convenient place. We can say that it is an artisan restaurant; you should not expect a restaurant; but they are still quite good in terms of price and performance. As of July 1; prices will increase,

366,Although they are actually a place that makes waffles; their burgers are delicious and they have a lot of options.,
244,The presentations are very good; it obviously has a skilled and attentive chef. Fish and squid are fresh.,
111,In terms of price; it is above Marmaris prices. In other words; there are menus with prices above the average. I was satisfied with almost everything I ate and drank.,

905,Although it is not as much as an urfa; it is the only place that can eat liver under samsun conditions. Appetizers can be improved. There should definitely be green mint next to the liver; arugula does not suit the liver.,
101,"I would like to thank the service in Fethiye branch and especially Mr. Samet; the official here, for his interest and relevance.",
874,Ambiance were pretty good.,
334,I ate the best dove I've ever eaten here. Everyone should come!!,
410,I definitely come here every time I come; I like both breakfast and evening meals; but prices have increased a lot from last year to this year.,
696,In terms of taste; I can't say it's too good because we drink much better ones. As a business performance; even bread is sold for money alongside soup.,
766,Friendly waiters; nice service and delicious food. In addition; the price is also affordable.,
452,Ambient food; nice open area; heated pet friendly place; renovated garden is very nice.,
450,Even though the service is terrible; they ask for a service fee of 144 TL; what a nonsense!,
617,Each mussel costs 7 liras. The place is big can sit inside and outside. There is a Bosphorus view in the place.,

885,Local dishes and soups are nice.,
724,Appetizers were good. The size of the lahmacun was good; Even though I ordered spicy; it came painless.,
669,It's delicious and the prices are reasonable. The appetizers are very filling and satisfying.,
1090,Definitely do not go without a reservation; it was overcrowded. We ate very delicious pizzas; but waiting in line for 1 hour didn't make any sense.,

1061,Flat white is very tasty and affordable. The interior of the place is very nicely decorated; I was like amazed.,
333,Excellent. I recommend.,
166,The atmosphere is very nice; the flavors are also very good; but the prices are a bit high.,

107,They are very fast and the food tastes good too.,
236,The most successful steak restaurant in the region. It is also a world brand. With its carefully selected meats and cooking technique; it gives the price you what you pay.,
245,DEFINITELY DO NOT COME. We came here for breakfast based on the reviews on the way. We said the breakfast called the village breakfast for 2 people. First of all; the employee greeted us disrespectfully; a thousand pieces falling off his face; reluctant movements etc. It didn't taste good either!,
56,Although the prices are a little high; the quality is high so it does not disappoint. The taste was very good; well done!,

783,The sauces are very tasty. People are friendly and the place is very clean.,
72,Some of the coffee I wanted came spilled; the coffee tasted dry. Also; my wife's order was wrong.,
332,The material of the kumru is medium quality; the portion is small. We were 3 persons. All three of us had burnt bread.,
322,Delicious!,
114,As we were passing on the road; it was pleasing to our eyes and we dived in. It was good overall.,
320,We ordered sole fish; fried haddock; fried mussels; and sardines. Our favorite among them was sole fish. The only thing that bothered me was that the men's and women's toilets were a common and single toilet.,
139,It is a business that serves 2 orange juices that are not on the breakfast menu and that I did not order; as if they were on the menu; and charges an extra 40 TL.,
193,Kimbap wasn't for me; it's a tough flavor.,
274,If you come to Kaş and do not eat bunbun here; you are not considered to have come to Kaş. I would definitely recommend you to try it. Especially the ayran is wonderful.,
430,It's too plentiful; so I guess the prices are high. But a mixture of so many different dishes was not that good.,
853,Food was a bit salty due to soy sauce. Prices are in line with the market.,
919,The prices were in the 120-140 range. I didn't like Lahmacun. The appetizers were nice.,
1051,Expensive place.,
308,I came with recommendation and it really tasted good. It doesn't have a very different taste; so I don't think you will have a problem whether it fits your palate or not.,
539,I tried Kayseri's traditional ravioli and special ravioli. The special was just right for my taste. I like. We also tried yaglama but it wasn't as good as I imagined. It was also cold.,
679,Everything I ate that in a super menu; was very good. I recommend this place to everyone.,
542,First of all; they don't accept credit cards. The place is small; you can wait in line to sit. It's worth the taste.,
40,"It was very expensive, but taste wasn't bad.",
315,Liked.,
389,I had eaten Beyran in a few places; but I didn't like it very much. I drank here and liked it. I can drink it every day.,

345,Great service.,
782,Credit card is not accepted. The flavors are good.,
735,Good place. Meals were good. Service is also good. There is parking in front for cars.,
1012,Too expensive; I can cook better. Also; ambiance of the restaurant is old.,
902,Yummy yummy! Delicious!,
142,Seaside; pleasant place; mediocre food; owners concerned.,
524,It is very delicious; even the yogurt. However; a very very expensive portion of Iskender should not be 225 liras…,
763,Excellent food and ambiance.,
105,In general; everything was good; but the tables were not collected during the 35-45 minutes I was there. It was messy inside.,
449,Unfortunately; the waiters are very uninterested. Since there are too many Arab customers; the attention and interest is more towards them. Stones were found in my food?!,
980,Great service and reasonable prices. Recommend!,
93,Mushroom burger the meat stays thin inside the huge burger bread; and the meat and mushrooms do not stay in the bread because of the sauce applied on the bread.,
205,Prices are not real; we thought it was a camera joke.,
678,Bad breakfast experince for me.,
295,Everything you eat is very fresh and delicious. The back of the place is in the concept of a restaurant and the 2nd floor is in the concept of a cafe. We liked it very much.,
355,Definitely the best soufflé I've had in a long time. I am satisfied; I recommend.,
347,Their service was a little slow; the flavors were on point. I had breakfast; there was unlimited tea; it was a different situation that they brought the tea in a water glass.,
311,Great atmosphere!,
278,Orders that came really shockingly fast and the treats were delicious.,
1099,No bad. It was very crowded; there was no lighting outside; so we could look at the menu with phone flashlights.,
754,"The place is nice; Mumbar was smelling bad and the stone came out, I didn't eat it. The mince in the icli kofte was bad; sour. It's also an expensive restaurant.",

68,The place is beautiful. The staff was very nice. We asked for tiramisu. It was very fresh and beautiful.,
831,We had a pleasant time. The ambiance was nice.,
200,Patso starts from 50tl. It comes with lots of potatoes in the bread wrapped in paper; dipped in ketchup or mayonnaise according to your needs. You have to eat standing up. It does not have a special flavor; but it is satisfying,
920,Every time I go; the prices change; I don't like it. But even for the treats; you can go; which comes as many appetizers; tea; etc. as you want.,
842,I didn't like the atmosphere or the decor either. The lower floor is in front of the highway. Trucks are passing by; you're eating pies. It's not nice and it's expensive. Oh; and there are a lot of beggars.,
30,Nice intimate restaurant. Good service. Eye for detail. Clean. Really good food; well presented.,
121,Delicious. However; prices are as high as Marmaris in general in 2021.,

732,The ambiance is large and airy. The waiters are attentive and the service is fast. The tomato paste goes well with the trotter. The price is very reasonable.,
689,Good in general. Quality for Kızılay and its surroundings. Lahmacun doesn't taste old...,

362,Not very special Gaziantep dishes; but you can find a comfortable and serene atmosphere in Antep. One of the places that can be stylish for the evening.,
261,I tried tantuni with yoghurt for the first time. The taste was perfect. I would recommend it to everyone. It reminds me of the taste of iskender.,
454,We went for both breakfast and dinner. First of all; it has a very nice environment. When we went for breakfast; we sat inside and one can sit for hours. Its decoration; quiet and nice; being in the trees is very nice. Especially having an open kitchen adds a positive score to the customer.,
335,"Crowded but no problem, flavor is okay.",
372,I can say that it is the only cafe in Samsun where you can eat waffle dessert properly. You can go without thinking.,

621,Not too good; not too bad either.,
425,Great.,
615,The croissants were delicious but tasted a bit bitter due to overcooking. The croissant with adjika was excellent. But we waited a long time,
1039,Their products are delicious and the sizes are nice. It is very difficult to take orders from the waiters because it is crowded. In addition; the prices should have been more affordable.,
52,The food tastes good. The atmosphere of the place was not very attractive.,
328,We ate our meal on the top floor; the location of the place was beautiful. The flavors and portions were good. I suggest you to eat fish bread.,

169,We ordered breakfast; the table was full. It was truly fascinating. I advise.,
951,Gaziantep was one of the cities we visited during our trip to Southeast Anatolia. We decided to eat baklava from Kocak Baklava.

1008,The taste of hamburgers is not as good as exaggerated. It's also an expensive restaurant.,

536,The ravioli tasted good and was satisfying as a portion; the portion was very small compared to the price of the yaglama.,
668,I liked the kebab and salad; but I can't say the same for their appetizers. It was less in variety; unfortunately; it was unpleasant for those who came. The ambiance was great.,
421,The view is nice; the indoor seating area is quite large.,
523,There is no problem of waiting queue; the ambiance of the place is nice; well done.,

77,Prices are nice,
623,I had the chance to try classic mussels and mussels with sauce. Both were beautiful. Kokorec was also good.,
426,The prices were too high for a place that sells pastries or pastries.,
140,We sat at the table; 10m away from the water; went for a swim and then came back to our table. They have changing cabins inside; very clean. Tried some cocktails and they were really good; but prices are like in Kos; Greece where we came from.,

520,Iskender is very delicious; you can optionally pour butter; what is interesting to me is that there are no treats.,
791,Super delicious chicken; best in town.,
87,Their prices are very reasonable and their ice creams are delicious. There is not only ice cream but also dessert sales inside. There are many options for ice cream; which is a very nice detail.,
1032,There are two parts that you can eat standing or sitting; I'm sure it will be much more enjoyable if you eat sitting down. It is served pretty fast. Prices are reasonable compared to peers.,
671,Three Portions of Adana Kebab on one skewer and 3 drinks for 106 TL. My expectation was higher in terms of taste; but I cannot say that I could fully find this expectation. But the side dishes were not bad.,
