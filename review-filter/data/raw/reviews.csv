3,Prices are very affordable. The menu in the photo cost 108 liras. You have to wait 10-15 minutes for food. Staff is annoying. Well it tastes good. Boiled meat was delicious.,0
4,Turkey's cheapest artisan restaurant and its food is delicious!,0
6,Generally good.,0
7,What you see is 125 TL in total. It's a pretty convenient place. We can say that it is an artisan restaurant; you should not expect a restaurant; but they are still quite good in terms of price and performance. As of July 1; prices will increase,0
10,The most f/p of all businesses I've seen.,0
11,The food was just like the ones my mother made. Prices were reasonable.,0
13,"Flavor : It has nothing but dough taste. Labor : Not befitting a touristic place. Service : There was no wet wipes and napkins on the table, but there was no sympathetic family to say. This service and this taste were not available at this price.",0
24,Without any taste how they are at the first rank!!!! We ate cafe Inn pizza. It was 70 tl.,0
26,The vegan breakfast made me extremely happy. It was nice.,0
30,Nice intimate restaurant. Good service. Eye for detail. Clean. Really good food; well presented.,0
31,The food is delicious but a little pricey. The best Cappucino in Datça is here..,0
32,It's a very delicious; beautiful small business; but the appointment is a bit difficult to find; the pizzas are great Cafe Inn pizza and a wonderful 4 cheese and brownie as dessert. Thank you for your good wishes.,0
34,"It is a very, very expensive place. It took 30 minutes for 2 drinks to arrive.",0
40,"It was very expensive, but taste wasn't bad.",0
45,It was very nice to be greeted with a smile when we first entered; we went with my wife; the services are very fast; the empty services are removed immediately; the washbasins were hygienic and clean; and I would recommend a very reasonable place.,0
50,When I ate it in the past; it tasted very good; I think the chef has changed. The atmosphere was average.,0
52,The food tastes good. The atmosphere of the place was not very attractive.,0
55,Ayran came when the meal was over; the food was very bitter.,0
56,Although the prices are a little high; the quality is high so it does not disappoint. The taste was very good; well done!,0
57,We ordered Etli Ali Nazik Kebab. They said he was the most famous. We ate meat with yogurt. The food was cold.,0
59,Ali nazik was 240 tl lahmacun 50 tl even tea with a fee of 5 tl. We visited so many places; this was the most expensive.,0
60,The taste was very good but the prices were also very high.,0
61,Located in Gaziantep historical bazaar; the place stands out with its beautiful and spacious ambiance. I liked the place very much; we came for dessert after dinner.,0
63,The restaurant that made our four-day Gaziantep holiday poison! There is already excessive noise; it is impossible to hear the person next to you. The waiters are indifferent; the order takes too long to arrive.,0
64,"They sold us rotten pistachios, it sucks!",0
66,"A great business that does not compromise on its taste; lahmacun, garlic kebab; yoghurt kebab; the smile of the waiters; everything is in place; thank you very much for the nice service and delicious food.",0
67,The breakfast was very good; I recommend it; the presentations were also eye-catching. We paid 240tl for the table you see in the photo; including 6 teas and 2 Turkish coffees.,0
68,The place is beautiful. The staff was very nice. We asked for tiramisu. It was very fresh and beautiful.,0
71,They have a problem with the service; but if you're going to drink tea; they do it well. Your tea is always hot over the fire.,0
72,Some of the coffee I wanted came spilled; the coffee tasted dry. Also; my wife's order was wrong.,0
73,Great.,0
77,Prices are nice,0
78,Bitter; mango; Bodrum tangerine; honey almond; Big Babas; mastic gum; walnut; blackberry and forest fruit definitely recommend..,0
79,The prices are cheap from the center; the ice cream is legendary; don't miss out; it's worth waiting in line; it's the best ice cream shop in Fethiye. Real milk ice cream,0
82,As I was crossing the road; I noticed that we stopped. The light ad is very good because everything has ice cream icons. The only normal price I've seen in Fethiye is 6 TL.,0
83,The atmosphere of the place was nice; if you want to taste the ice creams; I can say that it is an ordinary ice cream that you can eat anywhere.,0
84,It literally gave me the feeling of chewing sugar. It's not even about ice cream.,0
85,We visited with my friends. The lemon one was great!,0
87,Their prices are very reasonable and their ice creams are delicious. There is not only ice cream but also dessert sales inside. There are many options for ice cream; which is a very nice detail.,0
89,The hamburger bread was very nice. I didn't like his meatballs very much.Orders are coming out very quickly; and the working friends are very kind; thank you.,0
93,Mushroom burger the meat stays thin inside the huge burger bread; and the meat and mushrooms do not stay in the bread because of the sauce applied on the bread.,0
95,I never liked the service very bad; when we brought the wrong burger and returned it; we had to wait that much longer. The potatoes were terrible; the only onion rings and mushrooms were beautiful. I will never go to this place again.,0
97,The menu content is beautifully varied and satisfying.,0
98,The price was not right; I bought a 2-piece menu; the burger and bread did not taste good.,0
101,"I would like to thank the service in Fethiye branch and especially Mr. Samet; the official here, for his interest and relevance.",0
102,The menu is incomplete; not much; usually a disaster with happy sweet toys; felt-tip pens and a few cardboard coloring pages.,0
105,In general; everything was good; but the tables were not collected during the 35-45 minutes I was there. It was messy inside.,0
107,They are very fast and the food tastes good too.,0
108,The potatoes were almost dead and tasteless.,0
110,There was a hair in the fries; disgusting.,0
111,In terms of price; it is above Marmaris prices. In other words; there are menus with prices above the average. I was satisfied with almost everything I ate and drank.,0
114,As we were passing on the road; it was pleasing to our eyes and we dived in. It was good overall.,0
119,Great concept and very tasty food.,0
121,Delicious. However; prices are as high as Marmaris in general in 2021.,0
129,Familiar coffee that I taste,0
137,A pleasant place with a beach; delicious food,0
138,It is a place where you can both enter at home and spend time with pleasure and eat and drink. The beach is very beautiful; your sea is clean. The food is also very good.,0
139,It is a business that serves 2 orange juices that are not on the breakfast menu and that I did not order; as if they were on the menu; and charges an extra 40 TL.,0
140,We sat at the table; 10m away from the water; went for a swim and then came back to our table. They have changing cabins inside; very clean. Tried some cocktails and they were really good; but prices are like in Kos; Greece where we came from.,0
142,Seaside; pleasant place; mediocre food; owners concerned.,0
146,It has a location by the sea; a layout that allows for indoor and outdoor seating. Their waiters are nervous and sometimes indifferent.,0
157,A delicious doner.,0
159,Interest was good; but doner was a complete disaster. First of all; it came cold; there was no proper sauce in it; there was so much onion that I could not taste the meat at all.,0
166,The atmosphere is very nice; the flavors are also very good; but the prices are a bit high.,0
169,We ordered breakfast; the table was full. It was truly fascinating. I advise.,0
175,The restaurant is well located and above all it is nicely decorated and clean.,0
179,The okra soup was hot and scrumptious to the broth. The meat loaf and tandoori kebab were excellent. We ate in the garden with pleasure in a cool weather.,0
183,I had heard that meatloaf was good; but the taste was not that praiseworthy.,0
185,Waiters were better than Meram branch. Although the taste of Etliekmek is not very good; you can easily bring your guests from outside the city.,0
193,Kimbap wasn't for me; it's a tough flavor.,0
197,Super taste; best rose rabokki I've ever eaten in my life. At the same time; we ordered a gimbap with kimchi; and we think it suits them very well.,0
199,The flavor that I ate as a child is here; but there were many queues; as in all parts of Istanbul.,0
200,Patso starts from 50tl. It comes with lots of potatoes in the bread wrapped in paper; dipped in ketchup or mayonnaise according to your needs. You have to eat standing up. It does not have a special flavor; but it is satisfying,0
205,Prices are not real; we thought it was a camera joke.,0
209,Great patso!,0
210,160-year-old Vefa Bozacisi has not lost its flavor. We can find filled bottles in many places; but it's different to come here and drink. It's definitely fresher to drink on the spot.Vefa Bozacısı,0
211,It was very nice to taste the boza in the historical place. Way better than other bozas.,0
214,Same taste for years. Its historical texture is another beautiful place.,0
216,The number of tables is very small; but no problem; the taste was very good.,0
219,Vefa Bozacisi must be the most beautiful place that comes to mind when Boza is mentioned. The groceries are quite affordable.,2
221,It is not p/p. Doner came cold and that's why it was hard.,0
222,Eating with this view... It was legendary!,0
232,"When we asked for a hamburger, we were told that it was not left; but the hamburger came to the side table; I'm breaking two points from here; other than that it was good.",0
236,The most successful steak restaurant in the region. It is also a world brand. With its carefully selected meats and cooking technique; it gives the price you what you pay.,0
238,I do not recommend the lamb cage at all. But skewered and tenderloin are great. My carrot slice isn't bad. The waiters are interested and polite; but there are difficulties in understanding the order. You would like it cooked well; it comes undercooked.,0
239,We've been here many times and each time we left satisfied; Lokum meat; spaghetti; nusret hamburger; salad with tulum cheese; etc. very good but of course high in price compared to many places.,0
244,The presentations are very good; it obviously has a skilled and attentive chef. Fish and squid are fresh.,0
245,DEFINITELY DO NOT COME. We came here for breakfast based on the reviews on the way. We said the breakfast called the village breakfast for 2 people. First of all; the employee greeted us disrespectfully; a thousand pieces falling off his face; reluctant movements etc. It didn't taste good either!,0
248,Mexican chicken was hearty; hot and fresh in portion. Service was a little late. An ideal place to dine with a lake view.,0
249,Koycegiz is the most popular restaurant and cafe. You can have a meal with the view of Köyceğiz lake and sip your cold beer with pleasure.,0
250,A place we stopped by for breakfast on the way. The place has a beautiful view of Köyceğiz lake. The owner is very sweet and helped us with everything.,0
251,It was rainiy but the ambiance was good enough.,0
255,In general; it is delicious; you can ask for both wrap and bread. Although the waiting time is around 10 minutes; the red cabbage and pickled peppers served from the front satisfy you.,0
257,Tantuni was amazing. Thank you Cici Tantuni!,0
260,The ambiance of the place was a bit dark.,0
261,I tried tantuni with yoghurt for the first time. The taste was perfect. I would recommend it to everyone. It reminds me of the taste of iskender.,0
262,Prices are like that.,0
266,A fast food restaurant with very friendly staff. It didn't appeal to my taste at all. Undercooked dough and lint meat.,0
267,Overall it wasn't bad. It was delicious and ice cold. Mohair meat was delicious. The fries were nice. However; the bread that gives the place its name is a disappointment.,0
271,I can say that cleanliness; taste; warm-blooded employees were absolutely perfect.,0
274,If you come to Kaş and do not eat bunbun here; you are not considered to have come to Kaş. I would definitely recommend you to try it. Especially the ayran is wonderful.,0
276,Even though it was overcrowded; our orders came very quickly. Except for the künefe; all the treats were delicious. The künefe tasted oily. I recommend you to go to a very clean and relevant place.,0
278,Orders that came really shockingly fast and the treats were delicious.,0
281,The treats are constantly being refreshed.. all the waiters are very interested.. The taste was not overly good.,0
282,There was no delay in meals. As soon as the soup was finished; the meal arrived. The meals are quite delicious.,0
286,Appetizers and service came quickly. The glasses are badly scratched. Especially the fries were fresh and delicious. Raw meatballs and stuffed meatballs were like mud without flavor.,0
287,I recommend profiteroles and meringue; they are their own production. The entrance is suitable for the disabled. It's good that they're paying attention to this.,0
290,The cheddar pastry was very bad compared to the past. It has reached the level of a normal patisserie; it used to be better.,0
291,We went to eat dessert as a family and we were satisfied. It was a bit crowded.,0
293,Very good quality and expensive also always crowded.,0
295,Everything you eat is very fresh and delicious. The back of the place is in the concept of a restaurant and the 2nd floor is in the concept of a cafe. We liked it very much.,0
297,Recommend.,0
299,"Bagel / crispy is tasteless; the outer crust is hard, and the tea is tasteless due to its water. Boiled egg craved but I gave up because it was peeled.",0
300,Prices are very affordable; boyoz is fresh and nice. Finding breakfast items such as olives; cheese and honey in addition to Boyoz also adds to the beauty.,0
306,I ate boyoz for the first time. For me; I guess I wouldn't eat it again. Frankly; it's not a taste that I will look for and miss.,0
307,I ate a variety of boyoz for the first time and I liked it very much. The service is fast and the atmosphere is friendly. If you come to Izmir; do not pass by here.,0
308,I came with recommendation and it really tasted good. It doesn't have a very different taste; so I don't think you will have a problem whether it fits your palate or not.,0
309,It was the best SushiCo restaurant I've experienced. Sushi was perfect and delicious.,0
310,First of all; our orders came very quickly. Edamame came without salt; which we liked a lot. You can add your own. We ordered tuna and salmon as sashimi. I couldn't eat good sashimi in Istanbul for a long time; unfortunately this place did not pass the exam.,0
311,Great atmosphere!,0
313,The food is fresh; delicious and the atmosphere is quality as always.,0
315,Liked.,0
319,Very clean restaurant... Tasty suchi and noodles.,0
320,We ordered sole fish; fried haddock; fried mussels; and sardines. Our favorite among them was sole fish. The only thing that bothered me was that the men's and women's toilets were a common and single toilet.,0
322,Delicious!,0
324,Our back hurt while eating; the place was clean.,0
328,We ate our meal on the top floor; the location of the place was beautiful. The flavors and portions were good. I suggest you to eat fish bread.,0
329,I went to there with my girl friend; I liked fishes but she did not like because fishes are a little bit oily.,0
332,The material of the kumru is medium quality; the portion is small. We were 3 persons. All three of us had burnt bread.,0
333,Excellent. I recommend.,0
334,I ate the best dove I've ever eaten here. Everyone should come!!,0
335,"Crowded but no problem, flavor is okay.",0
337,I'm really surprised; it's a huge business; but the staff is so indifferent and bored.,0
343,The order came fast. I loved the doner and chicken. It was well cooked. But orders came late.,0
345,Great service.,0
347,Their service was a little slow; the flavors were on point. I had breakfast; there was unlimited tea; it was a different situation that they brought the tea in a water glass.,0
351,Kofteci Yusuf tastes the same everywhere. employees are constantly running towards somewhere; it is very difficult to catch and order.,0
352,We told the staff a very modest breakfast plate; there is unlimited tea; and the breakfast was really good. There was everything up to 4 kinds of cheese and it only cost 54 liras.,0
353,Nice atmosphere; pleasant place. The employees are young; smiling and fast. The breakfast is very nice. Souffles are A-MA-ZING!,0
355,Definitely the best soufflé I've had in a long time. I am satisfied; I recommend.,0
356,Asian salmon pastas and salad varieties are very successful. They have not neglected to share the secret of their taste.,0
360,I tried Antep taco; I liked.,0
362,Not very special Gaziantep dishes; but you can find a comfortable and serene atmosphere in Antep. One of the places that can be stylish for the evening.,0
363,Taco; on the other hand; was no different than a vegetable wrap wrapped in lavash. It was a decent experience.,0
366,Although they are actually a place that makes waffles; their burgers are delicious and they have a lot of options.,0
368,You can add the product you want to the waffle or hamburger with your own choice. You're kind of the chief.,0
371,It's a great place with everything; it's a very good place whether it's about food or interest; it's a very nice place for waffles.,0
372,I can say that it is the only cafe in Samsun where you can eat waffle dessert properly. You can go without thinking.,0
378,Location of the restourant was good; easy to access.,0
381,Good place to eat. However; the staff work poorly: They can easily forget to bring some dishes or add seasonings; even though they previously admitted to the contrary.,0
382,Not the best; but not bad.,0
389,I had eaten Beyran in a few places; but I didn't like it very much. I drank here and liked it. I can drink it every day.,0
390,We went for Beyran but it didn't in menu today. We had to order lahmacun and kebab. The lahmacun is awful; the adana kebab and lamb shish kebab are delicious.,0
391,I ate katmer here for the first time and I couldn't forget its taste and smell. It may be the most beautiful dessert in the world!!,0
395,I'm ending my vacation by leaving my favorite food here..,0
399,They used to taste better; the chef must have changed.,0
405,Due to the crowd; my order came late; there is no problem other than that.,0
406,The food is delicious; the view is beautiful.,0
410,I definitely come here every time I come; I like both breakfast and evening meals; but prices have increased a lot from last year to this year.,0
414,My first stop for breakfast in Atakum is a place with quality service and friendly face.,0
421,The view is nice; the indoor seating area is quite large.,0
424,Good with potatoes; good with cheese; medium with spinach; medium with minced meat. Plain pastry was good; pastry was good. I did not like the tea.,0
425,Great.,0
426,The prices were too high for a place that sells pastries or pastries.,0
428,Service sucks. Customer care is below zero. The view is very good but the place is extremely neglected.,0
429,It gets very crowded because it's the weekend; we have to go a little early; you may not find a place to eat something,0
430,It's too plentiful; so I guess the prices are high. But a mixture of so many different dishes was not that good.,0
431,The most delicious rice I have ever eaten. The ambiance of the environment is terrific; its desserts were amazing too.,0
433,The place is beautiful and clean. The employees were very kind and concerned. I ate rice and also had sautéed chicken. The flavor was good except the chicken sauté was greasy.,0
434,Prices was high.,0
436,250 TL account was received for 1 portion of rice + kuru fasulye + ayran + Cola. Service and waiters are very bad.,0
437,It's not something to be exaggerated; and people come from out of town just for their rice. The waiters were kind; the environment was clean.,0
440,The menu is very nice; the food is legendary; also the waiters were very polite.,0
443,"They have very delicious meat; especially tiny lahmacun, super appetizers; delicious food here. The food is very nice. The workers can be a little more interested. They are very interested in Arab customers. They don't care about us. This situation makes us sad.",0
446,We came with a guest from abroad; everything was perfect. Taste; cleanliness; service..,0
449,Unfortunately; the waiters are very uninterested. Since there are too many Arab customers; the attention and interest is more towards them. Stones were found in my food?!,0
450,Even though the service is terrible; they ask for a service fee of 144 TL; what a nonsense!,0
452,Ambient food; nice open area; heated pet friendly place; renovated garden is very nice.,0
454,We went for both breakfast and dinner. First of all; it has a very nice environment. When we went for breakfast; we sat inside and one can sit for hours. Its decoration; quiet and nice; being in the trees is very nice. Especially having an open kitchen adds a positive score to the customer.,0
458,Great place.. Contrary to the comments; the employees were interested.. The hot dog was impressive.. The hamburger was not bad.,0
459,Despite the current times; it was a very pleasant visit. They currently don't take booking; they have a walk-in system where you put your name down and after a short wait they seat you inside. Once inside you can opt to be put on a waitlist to sit outside. The setting is really nice and rustic and the tables are well distanced. There was a nice evening crowd and a good energy in the ambience.,0
463,Excellent taste; and the shabbyness of the place was also nice.,0
465,It's a place with very affordable and delicious pasta. Actually; there is not much variety of pasta. Classic pasta is served with cheddar cheese and sauce. I think the taste and price of the pasta is very good.,0
466,They serve an uncooked pasta with a tasteless sauce and cheese and some corn. Half portion is 20 TL. It didn't suit my taste.,0
468,classic alavara pasta; if you don't have a tiny little stomach; say it right. Pasta 42 TL price performance product...,0
478,The best hamburger restaurant in Istanbul. Cooking and sauce is very good.,0
480,The delicious combination of truffle sauce and burger was legendary.,0
482,Well prepared hamburger; special taste. But a little bit expensive.here/,0
486,I definitely recommend the seasonal kenger pizza. We also loved the sauce in three different olive oils; one with garlic; thyme and hot pepper.,0
487,You can't get enough of the thin pizza dough. Overcrowded employees are very concerned. We ate pizza at Mia highly recommend.,0
491,You should definitely go once and eat pizza. But I don't know if it happened to us; but the faces of the employees were never smiling and they were not caring.,0
494,The place is spacious; clean. Pizza dough is thin. You had the chance to try 6 types of pizza; I can say that the best is the model with spinach and smoked turkey.,0
495,"The dough is very crispy and the most successful part is definitely the dough. And the dough was waiting overnight. Also, there is a 2-3 hour queue; so crowded.",0
498,Meats are tasty without fat; but not very suitable for me. Since I like the meat cooked more; I couldn't enjoy it much anyway; I couldn't finish what I ordered. Although the portions are small; the prices are quite expensive.,0
505,We ate küşleme; it was amazing. But as you can see; really really expensive.,0
507,It was too oily and the place had problems with cleanliness.,0
508,It was too spicy on my first try; but after a few bites I got used to it. The taste is really good; I like it.,0
514,Great job; thank you!,0
515,we had a delicious tantuni experience. I was amazed by the taste of ayran; pickles and tantuni trio.,0
520,Iskender is very delicious; you can optionally pour butter; what is interesting to me is that there are no treats.,0
523,There is no problem of waiting queue; the ambiance of the place is nice; well done.,0
524,It is very delicious; even the yogurt. However; a very very expensive portion of Iskender should not be 225 liras…,0
526,The interior is very well designed. It has a historical texture. Employees were engaged. Frankly; the taste of iskender was not overly good; it was normal.,0
527,It was delicious as I heard.,0
528,Expensive; poor presentation; taste was not good enough to come from out of town and try. There are no treats.,0
529,The staff is very polite and very concerned. Thank you for the delicious food.,0
530,We ate oil ravioli and special ravioli. The ravioli was weak compared to the price. Employees are smiling.,0
531,We wanted to try it for yaglama; it was disappointing for me; it had little ground meat; it didn't taste good; the appetizers were bad.,0
532,Not perfect but good.,0
533,We ate special ravioli; classic ravioli; yaglama; they were not friendly; their yaglama was like minced meat pasta; not greasing.,0
534,A very pleasant and quiet restaurant. Most importantly; the food is great. Everything I tasted was delicious.,0
535,Recommend.,0
536,The ravioli tasted good and was satisfying as a portion; the portion was very small compared to the price of the yaglama.,0
539,I tried Kayseri's traditional ravioli and special ravioli. The special was just right for my taste. I like. We also tried yaglama but it wasn't as good as I imagined. It was also cold.,0
542,First of all; they don't accept credit cards. The place is small; you can wait in line to sit. It's worth the taste.,0
543,I loved it; with one word it was legendary. In other words; it is the best toast you can eat outside. The price is 35 TL for full Ayvalik toast; Ayran Lemonade is 15 TL.,0
544,Bread; cheese; sausage all left incredible flavors on our palate. We recommend it to everyone who will go to Ayvalık.,0
546,We paid 150 TL for 2 toast and 2 ayran. The only address of Ayvalık Toast. There are many queues; but the queue moves very quickly. Worth the wait.,0
550,Crispy and delicious toast.,0
552,What an awesome place. The fried starters were lush; as were the rice balls. However; the pizza was amazing; the best I have tasted (in Rome).,0
553,It was quite crowded so we waited in line for a long time. The flavor was good.,0
555,I strongly recommend. The best of the best. Very thin and soft. Nice service and reasonable price.,0
559,"Not touristic, that's why super. The place is real; truly local; authentic. Atmosphere here is really special. Waiters are cool guys; not trying to be super polite. Love it!",0
567,2 appetizers 1 salad the smell of blood and the taste of meat were disgusting chicken and lamb were fine.,0
569,A restaurant that has lost its previous refinement. Lahmacun as seen in the photo. The service is slow. I recommend a little more wannabe and attention.,0
571,We tried Lahmacun and Beyti. They both taste great.,0
576,We had a pleasant breakfast in a bright environment.,0
579,Great cafe. Excellent staff. Brilliant cakes and pastries.,0
582,The donut had no filling in it so it was like sweet bread.,0
584,Prices were cheap. But the queue was too long. I liked the flavors as a korean.,0
585,A delicious udon that you can enjoy even in the middle of summer! It was very hot; cramped and crowded with people and I had two bowls of udon and a side dish with two bottles of booze.,0
586,The set composition was good! Chicken egg rice and karaage were delicious. Many Koreans come here for udon. Waiters are friendly and service is fast!,0
588,5-10 min walk from the Louvre (depending on which side you come from). I ate really delicious things. I would definitely recommend.,0
589,The best udon restaurant in the capital! Few tables however; making a lot of waiting at peak times.,2
591,There were few tables and chairs inside.,0
594,The tempura here is amazing.,0
596,Very very bad food and very bad service 0/10.,0
599,I love fried chicken; I love KFC.,2
600,The menu I ordered was served hot; I ate it with my mouth and it was really perfect. But the place is very small and full to the brim. There is no place to sit.,0
602,The chickens are very nice and tasty; I will not say the same for the hamburger.,0
603,Not friendly; zero customer service. Pretty disappointing. Limited ketchup sauce only two per customer..,0
606,I ate a lot of croissants; but this was the best quality beautiful croissant I've ever eaten in my life. Crispy on the outside; with lots of butter on the inside; the smell was amazing.,0
615,The croissants were delicious but tasted a bit bitter due to overcooking. The croissant with adjika was excellent. But we waited a long time,0
616,You wait in line for 20-50 minutes when you leave. Eating the poached egg croissant left a strange feeling in the mouth. Egg with mushrooms was unsalted.,0
617,Each mussel costs 7 liras. The place is big can sit inside and outside. There is a Bosphorus view in the place.,0
618,The kokorec and sauced mussels of this branch next to the sea are quite good.,0
621,Not too good; not too bad either.,0
622,10 mussels + half a kokorec is 240TL. Also; the place smells like toilet.,0
623,I had the chance to try classic mussels and mussels with sauce. Both were beautiful. Kokorec was also good.,0
627,Magnificent view and legendary taste; and kokorec is also very good; I recommend it to everyone.,0
630,The rice was very oily but the roast was delicious. We paid 450₺ for 3 people. Prices are a little high.,0
635,I tried it after the positive reviews. Its rice and compote are nice. However; there are places in the Black Sea where I ate better roast beef. It's not a place I can say you should try. Prices are reasonable. The place is nice; the service was good.,0
637,My order arrived late and cold. Prices were high.,0
644,Great viewed restourant.,0
651,Izmir bomb was nice. The ice cream tasted like milk (not goat's milk) that I was not used to; but it didn't bother me.,0
662,It is a place that can be preferred for taste; but the appetizer variety is very weak. The toilets smelled.,0
667,The staff is very interested and fast; the environment is very nice; the food and appetizers are very tasty.,0
668,I liked the kebab and salad; but I can't say the same for their appetizers. It was less in variety; unfortunately; it was unpleasant for those who came. The ambiance was great.,0
669,It's delicious and the prices are reasonable. The appetizers are very filling and satisfying.,0
671,Three Portions of Adana Kebab on one skewer and 3 drinks for 106 TL. My expectation was higher in terms of taste; but I cannot say that I could fully find this expectation. But the side dishes were not bad.,0
674,Every meal is a source of happiness at Magro. This time we tried chicken with almond sauce and Mac and cheese bolognese; it was delicious. Portions are very filling and very reasonable for the price.,0
676,Unique in Alsancak Kordon.. Good food; especially chicken wrap is awesome.,0
678,Bad breakfast experince for me.,0
679,Everything I ate that in a super menu; was very good. I recommend this place to everyone.,0
680,Great service; great food; everything is great!,0
689,Good in general. Quality for Kızılay and its surroundings. Lahmacun doesn't taste old...,0
690,I go here for the lahmacun; I haven't tried their other dishes; but the lahmacun is very good.,0
693,Turkish meat doner was good; liked.,0
695,Definitely a good tripe soup; but I've had much better ones. Very clean place; prices are a bit expensive.,0
696,In terms of taste; I can't say it's too good because we drink much better ones. As a business performance; even bread is sold for money alongside soup.,0
697,Portion is enough; taste is average; but unfortunately there is no hygiene. We sat in the garden but there was a heavy smell in the environment.,0
698,I found the trotter soup I was looking for; it was very nice; thank you. Employees are not friendly.,0
701,Amazing!,0
702,The business demands money from everything; no treats!,0
708,Portions are big. The flavors are nice. Service is fast. Prices are normal. I recommend.,0
713,Covered doner kebab pita is also really delicious in lahmacun with cubed cheddar... The attention and care of the employees is extraordinary.,0
714,A delicious and clean place.,0
716,Meals were prepared neatly and cleanly. It was a pleasant dining experience in a decent place. Thank you very much.,0
717,The appetizer plates were very nice; we were very pleased that we went. We ordered 6 types of appetizers; lahmacun and stuffed meatballs. For dessert; we ordered burma kadayif and künefe.,0
719,I ate lahmacun; so it was good.,0
721,Thank you very much for bringing the flavors of Antakya here.,0
722,Nice atmosphere!,0
724,Appetizers were good. The size of the lahmacun was good; Even though I ordered spicy; it came painless.,0
725,Great dishes!!,0
729,We went for the tripe soup. I do not recommend; I did not like it; I ate better.,0
732,The ambiance is large and airy. The waiters are attentive and the service is fast. The tomato paste goes well with the trotter. The price is very reasonable.,0
735,Good place. Meals were good. Service is also good. There is parking in front for cars.,0
740,A decent place. You can eat as a family. You can eat many kinds of fish as grilled; fried or stewed.,0
747,I like fishes especially in this restourant. I ate sea bass and it was great.,0
754,"The place is nice; Mumbar was smelling bad and the stone came out, I didn't eat it. The mince in the icli kofte was bad; sour. It's also an expensive restaurant.",0
758,The food was delicious but not as exaggerated in other reviews or did not appeal to my taste. The environment is quite nice. The place was noisy because it was crowded.,0
759,Menu was like that; Recommend.,0
760,The attitude of the waiters towards the customer was cold.,0
762,Soup and tenderloin were delicious. Staff involved. Prices are reasonable.,0
763,Excellent food and ambiance.,0
765,Waiters didn't pay attention to me.,0
766,Friendly waiters; nice service and delicious food. In addition; the price is also affordable.,0
772,Bazlama and menemen were delicious. The place was not clean so I did not have a pleasant dining experience.,0
774,Delicious foods. I think place has to more cleaner.,0
778,Home cooking is not bad in terms of taste. We waited about an hour for the manti to eat. Also; the place is a little small.,0
781,I didn't like the food very much because it was too salty.,0
782,Credit card is not accepted. The flavors are good.,0
783,The sauces are very tasty. People are friendly and the place is very clean.,0
786,The irresistible taste of chicken; sauce and spice that has been increasing for years.,0
789,Place was not clear.,0
791,Super delicious chicken; best in town.,0
793,We ordered stuffed mumbar; artichokes; liked and tamarind sherbet. All of them were good in taste; quality of materials and presentation.,0
797,Famous place; fast service; caring staff; the taste of the sherbet we tried for the first time was legendary.,0
803,Everything was excellent. Thank you!,0
809,A decent place where you can dine under the trees; accompanied by the moonlight. Employees are friendly.,0
810,Be sure to ask for all prices in advance. You'd definitely get charged triple the price and these guys will try to scam you in all possible ways. Including overcharging the market price; charging you for double the weight of the fish & serving you a half the fillet and all the bones to charge you for all that.,0
811,The summer part of the place is stylish and pleasant; the view is wonderful. The food and appetizers are delicious. Prices were a little expensive.,0
812,Generally good service thank you!,0
822,We ordered cafe de paris; it was delicious; and the price was 35tl.,0
823,It is very crowded and arrives incredibly late. If you are very hungry; it is better to eat somewhere else.,0
825,It was a bit crowded; but it's okay; the flavors were good.,0
828,We went on a Friday and all the tables were full at first. Service; waiters; the ambiance is very nice. The menu was a little expensive.,0
829,Excellent service.,0
831,We had a pleasant time. The ambiance was nice.,0
835,Thanks for the nice service.,0
842,I didn't like the atmosphere or the decor either. The lower floor is in front of the highway. Trucks are passing by; you're eating pies. It's not nice and it's expensive. Oh; and there are a lot of beggars.,0
845,They have various and delicious products. Especially the age cakes are very successful. The materials they use in the products are of high quality; the prices are reasonable according to the quality.,0
847,it is a very nice place for high quality and special tastes; the employees and the owner are very interested and polite; we are going with love.,0
850,The ambiance of the place is nice but the food is not tasty. I don't think I will come again.,0
852,"The atmosphere is nice and the food is delicious. We tried noodles, spring rolls; hot and sour soup and an apple dessert.",0
853,Food was a bit salty due to soy sauce. Prices are in line with the market.,0
854,The plate in the photo was around 340 TL. Flavors may be a bit difficult for those who will try for the first time.,0
859,One of the places in Samsun with the most beautiful view and menu. A place where you can enjoy your dessert and coffee to the full while enjoying the sea view in front.,0
865,My guest and I went for dessert; we waited 10 minutes to get a menu; we placed orders; and we waited another 20 minutes. Of course; one person couldn't make it to the dozens of tables upstairs to work.,0
868,The address of quality. The service should be a little faster.,0
869,Unfortunately; the sorbet desserts are not satisfactory. The air conditioners are not working. It's a humid environment. I hope they fix it.,0
874,Ambiance were pretty good.,0
875,I like thailand foods but not like here ones.,2
880,Egg dish was super salty. Beef with veggies was really good. A bit on the pricier side compared with local Turkish food; but when your Thai GF wants a taste of home; hard to argue over price.,0
883,It's an expensive restaurant.,0
884,I especially recommend wedding soup; stuffed meatballs; manti and Inegöl meatballs.,0
885,Local dishes and soups are nice.,0
886,I did not recommend. Bad service.,0
889,Delicious food; but their toilets are filthy. That's why I'm deducting points.,0
891,The food is delicious; but we waited 1 hour after ordering and we were extremely hungry.,0
893,It has been wonderfully designed in its new location in Karaköy. It's gorgeous inside. Soundproofing I guess. The waiters are very interested and approaching with a smile. The appetizers and great service were very successful. Thanks.,0
902,Yummy yummy! Delicious!,0
905,Although it is not as much as an urfa; it is the only place that can eat liver under samsun conditions. Appetizers can be improved. There should definitely be green mint next to the liver; arugula does not suit the liver.,0
907,The employees are friendly. The prices are also very reasonable according to the food provided. I can call it the first choice in Samsun.,0
916,It's delicious; fast and has friendly staff. Although the price seems a little expensive; it meets this with unlimited tea; dessert service and appetizers.,0
919,The prices were in the 120-140 range. I didn't like Lahmacun. The appetizers were nice.,0
920,Every time I go; the prices change; I don't like it. But even for the treats; you can go; which comes as many appetizers; tea; etc. as you want.,0
922,The sauces and uncooked meats of the dishes give the impression of a meal prepared in the mall and not in a kebab restaurant.,0
925,Prices are reasonable; foods were delicious.,0
931,The waiters are scruffy so we didn't feel comfortable eating. The hygiene of the place was also bad.,0
935,The satisfying menu of local dishes; the taste of the food and the interest of the employees are very good. The advantage is that it is on the road and has its own parking lot.,0
940,Clean place; the service is good; Prices are not very cheap. generally the Arabs are leaving; locals are also present. Service is fast.,0
942,A restaurant where you can eat amazing seafood in a great atmosphere in Bursa. Its taste will really surprise you. I would like to remind you that there is no Alcohol in the restaurant. Bon appetit now!,0
946,The assortment is exceptionally good. Fish and accompanying appetizers are very diverse and sufficient. Everything was fresh.,0
947,The place was nice; but be aware of an expensive place.,0
951,Gaziantep was one of the cities we visited during our trip to Southeast Anatolia. We decided to eat baklava from Kocak Baklava. It is the number ten place for me with its understanding of both quality and service. When I come to Gaziantep again; I want to stop by here again and eat this baklava again.,0
954,Nice ambiance; tasty and crispy baklava and sobiyet.,0
963,Delicious!,0
965,It is a business that has exactly price performance products. You are eating home-cooked meals in a quiet; spacious and decent place with the service of friendly ladies.,0
971,Very bad customer satisfaction. The prices are so insane.,0
972,A good kebab place. The meat is very good; tasty; the meat is well cooked. The treats are sufficient and tasty.,0
975,The attention of the waiters to us was very nice. In addition; it felt pleasant to eat the hot meats.,0
978,The treats weren't enough. Also; as you can see in the photo; my food came a little burnt.,0
980,Great service and reasonable prices. Recommend!,0
981,We ordered a mixed breakfast for 3 people and they brought it for 2 people. Service quality is very low.,0
983,Location view is great. We ate meatballs and kuymak; it was nice. We thought that the dessert and samovar that followed was a treat; but I guess it wasn't.,0
984,We came across a slightly expensive menu with a magical view overlooking the lake and the Black Sea.,0
990,Its meatballs were good. What they served on the side was also good.,0
992,Unnecessarily expensive; the Arab is addressing the tourist. good taste.,0
995,The products are good but quite expensive. The place is more interested in tourists.,0
998,Affordable prices. Recommend.,0
999,You can find different tastes. It is open until late at night and serves with nice service.,0
1003,I tried the orient burger and cheesburger. Oriental burger was good; but nothing to exaggerate as described. King crab was okay; it felt like I was eating dough balls rather than crab. Mayonnaise was not good.,0
1004,The hamburger patty is very small; but it is very tasty and different with its unique sauce and bread. It was not pleasant that there were no potatoes in the menu.,0
1008,The taste of hamburgers is not as good as exaggerated. It's also an expensive restaurant.,0
1011,Burgers and fries were delicious. Burger meat came well cooked; I suggest you eat it medium cooked. The sauces are quite different and nice; you should definitely try it.,0
1012,Too expensive; I can cook better. Also; ambiance of the restaurant is old.,0
1019,No management; food is cold and bad quality; no ice in coke. Not happy at all. I recommend either change the airport manager or close that branch. Definitely bad service.,0
1020,Classical chicken; not awesome taste but it is ok.,0
1023,Delicious and reasonably priced!,0
1027,Great taste.,0
1028,There are many queues. There is a lack of coordination in the place. Even though you ask for service; they take the bill as soon as the food arrives. Not everyone can eat sitting down; We ate standing.,0
1032,There are two parts that you can eat standing or sitting; I'm sure it will be much more enjoyable if you eat sitting down. It is served pretty fast. Prices are reasonable compared to peers.,0
1035,We went for dessert; but there are also food and breakfast options. It's not a huge venue and it gets pretty busy. We ate moblan; ibiza; strawberry puff pastry desserts. Moblan comes in huge portions. Desserts are very tasty and fresh.,0
1039,Their products are delicious and the sizes are nice. It is very difficult to take orders from the waiters because it is crowded. In addition; the prices should have been more affordable.,0
1043,If you want to eat cake or dessert; the real taste is here. The place is very stylish in design. Each of the employees is very caring and helpful; but they have difficulty dealing with everyone because it is crowded.,0
1044,Desserts are good but waiters are very surly; We were not well received.,0
1046,Great venue great food appetizers. I can be a customer from now on.,0
1051,Expensive place.,0
1052,All meals were successful; I recommend.,0
1053,Lipa is a real old style tavern. There is a warm friendly atmosphere. Dry meat was very good.,0
1061,Flat white is very tasty and affordable. The interior of the place is very nicely decorated; I was like amazed.,0
1066,A cafe where books and coffee are combined very well.,0
1069,This café was highly recommended by an Istanbul-based blogger for its soufflés. The unique 2D interiors and decorations caught my eye as soon as I entered. I opted for the Chocolate with Orange soufflé; while my husband chose the Chocolate with Blueberries. I must say; the taste was absolutely amazing.,0
1074,It's a very small and elegant place; its decor attracted me as I passed by. This cafe specializes in souffles of various flavors and the service they have is excellent and the staff are welcoming and cheerful.,0
1089,The meat is DELICIOUS; the price is reasonable; but the service is poor.,0
1090,Definitely do not go without a reservation; it was overcrowded. We ate very delicious pizzas; but waiting in line for 1 hour didn't make any sense.,0
1094,Best pizza in the area; very crowded in weekends.,0
1099,No bad. It was very crowded; there was no lighting outside; so we could look at the menu with phone flashlights.,0
1100,Excellent pizza and fine wine. Both food and beverage portions are large. I recommend.,0
