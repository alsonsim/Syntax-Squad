Review Category Classifier is a web app that classifies google location reviews using an ensemble model of rule-based logic, TF-IDF, and Hugging Face's DistilBERT model. 

Features

-Web UI for easy review submission and classification

-FastAPI backend (Python) with modular, extensible ML logic

-Combines classic ML and deep learning for robust predictions

-Ready for local and cloud deployment



Prerequisites

-Python 3.8+

-Node.js 16+ (with npm)

-git (to clone repository)



ðŸš€ Quickstart

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Syntax-Squad.git

   cd Syntax-Squad/review-filter

2. Set up and launch FastAPI backend:

   python -m venv venv

   On Windows:
         venv\Scripts\activate

   On Mac/Linux:
         source venv/bin/activate

   pip install --upgrade pip
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   Place trained TF-IDF model at: models/tfidf_lr/model.joblib
   
   Place DistilBERT transformer files in: models/distilbert/

   Start the backend server:

      uvicorn src.app:app --reload

      Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs to check the API is live.

4. Set up and start React frontend

   npx create-react-app review-ui

   cd review-ui

   npm install

Replace review-ui/src/App.js with:

Start your frontend:

npm start
Go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Usage
1. Start both FastAPI (step 2) and React (step 3)

2. Enter a review (e.g., The food was great and service prompt!) and click Classify

3. See predicted category, ID, and confidence score

Troubleshooting
"npm error missing script: start" ->	cd review-ui before running npm start
'react-scripts' not recognized ->	Run npm install in review-ui
"error connecting to the server" ->	Ensure FastAPI backend running and URL matches
"ModuleNotFoundError" on backend ->	Match import statement & filename
Only "Unknown or unable to classify" ->	Backend might not be using models/rules ensemble

Deployment

Frontend:
In review-ui/, build for production:
npm run build
Deploy /build with Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

Backend:
Host FastAPI with Render, Railway, or a cloud VM.

Update API URL in React (App.js) to match your backend.

Example Input
"The food was delicious and the staff were friendly!"
